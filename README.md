A demo to show a Patient Progress Notes app


![Loaded screen](public/notes-list-loaded.png)

### Notes List pulling data from fake API
[Demo with fake backend](https://octoberclub.github.io/progress-notes-demo/)


### Requirements

The value of this feature is to create a single place to see the current status and history of a patient as they progress through their care journey. 

Some requirements: 
- Progress notes need to be listed in chronological order 
- Progress notes should be easy to read 
- It should be quick and easy for clinicians to add new notes 
- Some notes are automatically generated by the system (eg. the patient has submitted a questionnaire) 
- Some notes are written by clinicians (eg. “We ran out of time to successfully complete the first appointment so have booked in a follow up tomorrow afternoon.” 
- Multiple clinicians can work with a single patient, so understanding who wrote a note and when they did it is essential 
- Notes written by clinicians can be edited (by any user), notes generated by the system cannot. 
- Notes written by clinicians can be deleted (by their author), notes generated by the system cannot. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
